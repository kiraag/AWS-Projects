AWS CloudFront Distribution Project
Project Overview
This project involves the creation and deployment of an AWS CloudFront distribution with integration into Route 53 and an Application Load Balancer to serve content from a backend application hosted on EC2 instances.

Architecture Diagram

Explanation of architecture diagram, similar to the one you provided, detailing each component:

Users: End-users accessing the web application.
Route 53: DNS service routing user requests to the CloudFront distribution.
CloudFront: Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches content at edge locations to reduce latency and improve delivery speed.
Application Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances running the web application.
App Server: EC2 instances hosting the application.
Key Components
AWS Route 53: Used for DNS resolution, routing user requests to CloudFront.
AWS CloudFront: Configured to cache content from the application servers, reducing load and latency.
Application Load Balancer: Ensures high availability by balancing traffic between multiple application servers.
EC2 Instances: Backend servers hosting the application, registered under the load balancer.
